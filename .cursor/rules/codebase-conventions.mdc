# Codebase Conventions

## Export Patterns

- **index.ts files** (excluding db): Use namespace export pattern `export * as File from './file'`
- **All index.ts files** must only use namespace exports and contain no other code
- **Do NOT** re-export commonly used types/interfaces for convenience - import them directly from their source

## Naming Conventions

- **Interfaces**: Prefix all interfaces with `I` (e.g., `IUser`, `IMessageRepository`)
- **Types**: Prefix all types with `T` (e.g., `TUser`, `TMessage`)
- **Zod Schemas**: Prefix all zod schemas with `S` (e.g., `SUser`, `SMessage`)

## Code Organization

- **Interfaces**: All interfaces must be in `packages/shared/src`
- **Types**: All types must be in `packages/shared/src`
- **Zod Schemas**: All zod schemas must be in `packages/shared/src`

## Code Quality

### ESLint
- **Avoid** `eslint-disable` and `eslint-ignore` comments
- Fix linting issues properly instead of suppressing them

### Performance
- Improve time complexity (O(n)) where possible
- Optimize algorithms and data structures

### Backward Compatibility
- Remove code with backward compatibility
- Don't maintain deprecated code paths

### Logging
- Replace all `console.log` calls with proper logger
- Use the project's logging infrastructure

## TypeScript & SST

### SST Types
- Fix SST types using reference directive: `/// <reference path="../.sst/platform/config.d.ts" />`
- Read SST documentation to understand proper type configuration

### Type Documentation
- Always read documentation for any types you're using
- Ensure proper understanding before implementing

## Build & Lint Process

Before committing changes:

1. **Run linting**:
   ```bash
   pnpm lint:code
   pnpm lint:type
   ```
   Fix all issues before proceeding

2. **Run build**:
   ```bash
   pnpm build
   ```
   Fix all build issues before proceeding

## Git Practices

- **Commit in chunks**: Make focused, logical commits
- Group related changes together
- Avoid large, monolithic commits
- **No Co-Authored-By attributions**: Do not include Co-Authored-By in commit messages
- **Commit message format**: Use conventional commit format:
  - `feat`: New features
  - `fix`: Bug fixes
  - `refactor`: Code refactoring without functional changes
  - `docs`: Documentation updates
  - `test`: Adding or updating tests
  - `chore`: Maintenance tasks

## Code Comments

- **Don't write unnecessary comments**: The codebase should be self-explanatory
- Code should be clear enough that comments are not needed
- Only add comments when they provide essential context that cannot be inferred from code

## Design Principles

- **Use SOLID principles**: Apply Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, and Dependency Inversion
- **Use Gang of Four patterns**: Apply appropriate design patterns (Factory, Strategy, Repository, Adapter, Dependency Injection)
- **Don't over-engineer**: Keep solutions simple and appropriate for the problem
- **Self-explanatory code**: Write code that is clear and understandable without excessive documentation
